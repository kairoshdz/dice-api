# dice-api
This repository contains a dice API to implement into my existing dice roller app.

This API rolls a 6 sided die (or multiple). I personally used this on my dice blackjack game made for sprint 2 of CPSC-44000

I used AI to save time on the test file. I also followed the Azure tutorials for class which said to deploy web apps on Windows,
that ended up causing some problems as I had no idea I would have to create a web.config file which I was not too familiar with. In the future I will try to deploy on Linux when possible. I would have asked for more help on that part, but I was running low on time.
